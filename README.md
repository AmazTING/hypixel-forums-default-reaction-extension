# Default Reaction Extension

Lets you choose what reaction you have as a default on the hypixel forums


## Download Locally:
### Google Chrome
Download this repo as a ZIP file from GitHub

Unzip the file and you should have a folder named hypixelImageFix.

In Chrome go to the extensions page (chrome://extensions).

Enable Developer Mode at the top right.

Drag the hypixelDefaultReaction folder onto anywhere on the Chrome page to import it! (do not delete the folder afterwards)

I am currently working to have this added to the Google Chrome Web Store so hopefully that should be added soon.
